Overview of the Project 

Project:Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on Titanic Dataset

Objective
This project analysis is focus on understanding the relationships between various passenger attributes (such as age, gender, and ticket class) and their impact on survival. This project also aims to build and evaluate different machine learning models to find the most accurate approach for predicting survival.

Key Activities
1.Data Loading and Exploration:Load the Titanic dataset and perform initial exploration, including viewing the first few records and checking the data types, summary statistics, and missing values.

2.Data Cleaning:Handle missing data by analyzing the extent of missing values and applying appropriate strategies such as imputation or removal of irrelevant features.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Analyze relationships between features and the target variable (Survived) using visualizations like histograms, bar plots, and correlation matrices.

4.Feature Engineering:Create new features or modify existing ones to improve the model's predictive power.

5.Visualization:Visualize the results of the models and the important features contributing to predictions.

Technologies and Tools
 1.Programming Language: Python
 2.Libraries:
   Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
   NumPy: For numerical operations.
   Seaborn & Matplotlib: For data visualization.
   Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning models.
